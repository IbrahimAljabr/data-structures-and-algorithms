# Hash Table

- Create a simple hash table

## Challenge

- Create a simple hash table with collision as possible
- test the code for collision


## Approach & Efficiency

- to make it less complex as possible .
- space: O(log n)
- time: O(log 1)

## API

### add ()

This method will add to value to the table 

### hash ()

This method will take a key and hash the key, the hash key will be the index of the

### get ()
