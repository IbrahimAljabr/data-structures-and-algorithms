# Implementation: Graphs

- Implement Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list

## Challenge

- test the code for collision


## Approach & Efficiency

- to make it less complex as possible .
- space: O(log n)
- time: O(log n)

## API

### AddNode() 

Adds a new node to the graph

### AddEdge()

Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph

### GetNodes()

Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection

### GetNeighbors()

Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node

### Size()

Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
